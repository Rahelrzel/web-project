        <p>
            Hello! I'm Rahel, a passionate software engineering student with a strong interest in developing innovative solutions. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, where I have gained a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, C++, and Python. My coursework has exposed me to various aspects of software development, including data structures, algorithms, and software design principles.
            <br><br>
            Alongside my academic studies, I actively engage in personal coding projects and participate in coding competitions to enhance my problem-solving skills. These experiences have sharpened my ability to analyze complex problems and find efficient and elegant solutions. I have a keen eye for detail, and I am committed to writing clean, maintainable code that adheres to industry best practices.
            <br><br>
            As a lifelong learner, I am continuously expanding my skill set and keeping up with the latest trends in software development. I am eager to contribute my knowledge and skills to real-world projects and tackle new challenges. I believe that technology has the power to transform lives, and I am driven to make a positive impact through my work. If you have any exciting opportunities or would like to connect, feel free to reach out to me. I would love to hear from you!
